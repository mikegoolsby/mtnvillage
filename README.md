## MTN VILLAGE
This project replaces the traditional paper-based flipbook found in most short-term rentals. Accessed by a QR code, this application will be optimized for mobile but will have a responsive element and can be used on desktop via URL if need be. 

## WHAT DOES IT CONTAIN?
Basic information about the rental, house rules, check in/out information, and directions about how to access the amenities.

## TECH STACK
Next.js (open source React framework) with styled components to assist with CSS. Built in Pop_OS on a Lemur Pro from System76.
